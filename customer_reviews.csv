Mountain Series Helmet,2023-11-02,"The received garment was significantly smaller than expected, causing frustration due to size discrepancies between the published size chart and the actual product. The return process was complicated by glitches in the online portal and unresponsive customer service, who initially required the customer to pay for return shipping despite the sizing error being the company's fault. Despite promising features and high-quality materials, the garment's performance and durability couldn't be evaluated due to the sizing issues. The overall experience was disappointing for a premium brand.",-0.69523174,2050
Performance Racing Skis,2023-10-25,"The expensive skis, priced over $800, have underperformed, with significant chatter and vibration at high speeds on hard-packed snow. Durability issues include edge wear and a soft base material. The factory tune required professional tuning and had inconsistent edge angles. The skis lack the responsiveness and precision expected from high-end racing equipment. While suitable for casual resort skiing, they fail to meet expectations as racing skis. The brand's reputation in racing circles is disappointingly not reflected in the product's quality.",-0.6056858,2049
Thermal Gloves,2023-11-12,"The thermal gloves underperformed during the winter season, providing inadequate warmth below teens Fahrenheit, poor breathability leading to clammy hands, compromised dexterity, and lacking weather protection.
